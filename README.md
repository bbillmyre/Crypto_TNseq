Two sets of scripts for Billmyre et al.

First are a set of perl scripts that run from acds_extract_interleave_barcode_name.pl to map .fastq files of Ds inserts back to the H99 genome.

Second are a set of R scripts all contained in Crypto_h99_tnseq.R
These scripts are designed to be run line by line in RStudio rather than as a single executing script and contain code to produce the core of figure panels contained in the manuscript, although many had significant further assembly using Inkscape.
